uAdmin Tutorial Part 2 - Internal vs. External Models
=====================================================
In this part, we will discuss about the difference between internal and external models.

Internal Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Internal models are models inside your main.go and don’t have their .go file, they are useful if you want to make something quick.

The code below is an example of internal model:

.. code-block:: go

    package main

    import (
        "time"
        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
    )

    // Internal model with the model name of "Todo"
    type Todo struct {
        uadmin.Model
        Name        string
        Description string `uadmin:"html"`
        TargetDate  time.Time
        Progress    int `uadmin:"progress_bar"`
    }

    func main() {
        uadmin.Register(
            Todo{}, // Register the Todo model
        )
        uadmin.StartServer()
    }

External Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
External models are models outside of main.go and have their own .go file. Placing a model struct in an external Go file has several advantages over internal ones:

* Easily readable in coding
* Scalability for large size projects
* Minimize code conflicts for the development team
* Relevance for development (e.g. All registers are located in the models folder. Other functionalities are located in the related folders.)

Let’s create a new file for an external model named **todo.go** with the following codes below:

.. code-block:: go

    package models

    import (
        "time"

        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
    )

    // Todo Model !
    type Todo struct {
        uadmin.Model
        Name        string
        Description string `uadmin:"html"`
        TargetDate  time.Time
        Progress    int `uadmin:"progress_bar"`
    }

Now register the model on **main.go** where `models` is the package name and `Todo` is the model name:

.. code-block:: go

    package main

    import (
        // Specify the username that you used inside github.com folder
        "github.com/username/todo/models"

        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
    )

    func main() {
        uadmin.Register(
            models.Todo{}, // <-- place it here
        )

        uadmin.StartServer()
    }

Run your application. As expected, the Todo model was added in the uAdmin Dashboard.

Click Add New TODO.

Fill up the fields as shown in the example below.

.. image:: assets/todomodelcreate.png

|

Save it and new data will be added to your model.

Congrats, now you know how to create an external model and adding a new data in the model through the server.
