Your First App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's build your first app which is a Todo list. First, we will create a folder for your project and prepare it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo
    $ cd ~/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo
    $ uadmin prepare
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/models
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/api
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/views
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/media
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/static
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/templates

Use your favorite editor to create "main.go" inside that path. Put the
following code in "main.go".

.. code-block:: go

    package main

    import (
        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
        "time"
    )

    // Todo model ...
    type Todo struct {
	    uadmin.Model
	    Name        string
	    Description string `uadmin:"html"`
	    TargetDate  time.Time
	    Progress    int `uadmin:"progress_bar"`
    }

    func main() {
	    uadmin.Register(Todo{})
	    uadmin.StartServer()
    }

.. IMPORTANT::
   In Windows, you need to use localhost in order to run your application (e.g. http://localhost:8080). Another way is to set your loopback Internet protocol (IP) address by using uadmin.BindIP to establish an IP connection to the same machine or computer being used by the end-user.

Sample:

.. code-block:: go

    func main(){
        // Put this code before uadmin.StartServer
        uadmin.BindIP = "127.0.0.1"
    }

Now to run your code (Linux and Apple macOS):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ go build; ./todo
    [   OK   ]   Initializing DB: [9/9]
    [   OK   ]   Initializing Languages: [185/185]
    [  INFO  ]   Auto generated admin user. Username: admin, Password: admin.
    [   OK   ]   Synching System Settings: [30/30]
    [   OK   ]   Server Started: http://0.0.0.0:8080
             ___       __          _
      __  __/   | ____/ /___ ___  (_)___

    / /_/ / ___ / /_/ / / / / / / / / / /
    \__,_/_/  |_\__,_/_/ /_/ /_/_/_/ /_/

In Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    > go build && todo.exe
    [   OK   ]   Initializing DB: [9/9]
    [   OK   ]   Initializing Languages: [185/185]
    [  INFO  ]   Auto generated admin user. Username: admin, Password: admin.
    [   OK   ]   Synching System Settings: [30/30]
    [   OK   ]   Server Started: http://0.0.0.0:8080
             ___       __          _
      __  __/   | ____/ /___ ___  (_)___
     / / / / /| |/ __  / __  __ \/ / __ \
    / /_/ / ___ / /_/ / / / / / / / / / /
    \__,_/_/  |_\__,_/_/ /_/ /_/_/_/ /_/

If you go to the explorer, you will notice that there are automatically generated **.key** and **.salt** files hidden in your computer. **.key** is used for authentication process to assure that the key of the user ("person A" for instance) held by "person B" belongs to the authenticated user which is "person A". **.salt** is extra salt added to password hashing. They add an extra security to your application. Once they have been deleted, no one can login to your application unless you use the recovery admin account that is automatically generated by your terminal.

Save it and new data will be added to your model.

Well done! You have created your first application.

Publish your app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To take your app live, it is simple:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uadmin publish
    Enter your email: me@example.com
    Your project will be published to https://my-proj.uadmin.io
    Enter the name of your sub-domain (my-proj) [auto]: my-app
    Did you change the default port from 8080?
    This is the port you have in uadmin.Port = 8080
    Enter the port that your server run on [8080]:
    [   OK   ]   Compressing [420/420]
    [   OK   ]   Your application has been uploaded
    [   OK   ]   Application installed succesfully
    [   OK   ]   Your Project has been published to https://my-app.uadmin.io/
