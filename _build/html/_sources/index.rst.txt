Your First App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's build your first app which is a Todo list. First, we will create a folder for your project and prepare it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo
    $ cd ~/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo
    $ uadmin prepare
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/models
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/api
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/views
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/media
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/static
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/pc_name/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo/templates

Now use your code editor to create `main.go` and put this code inside it.

.. code-block:: go

    package main

    import (
        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
    )

    func main() {
        uadmin.StartServer()
    }

Prepare modules

.. code-block:: bash

   go mod init
   go mod tidy

Now to run your code (Linux and Apple macOS):

.. code-block:: bash

    go build; ./todo

In Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    go build & todo

Result:

.. code-block:: bash

    [   OK   ]   Initializing DB: [13/13]
    [   OK   ]   Initializing Languages: [185/185]
    [  INFO  ]   Auto generated admin user. Username: admin, Password: admin.
    [   OK   ]   Synching System Settings: [51/51]
    [   OK   ]   Server Started: http://0.0.0.0:8080

    / /_/ / ___ / /_/ / / / / / / / / / /
    \__,_/_/  |_\__,_/_/ /_/ /_/_/_/ /_/

.. IMPORTANT::
   In Windows, you need to use localhost in order to run your application (e.g. http://localhost:8080).

If you go to the explorer, you will notice that there are automatically generated **.key** and **.salt** files hidden in your computer.

**.key** is used for authentication process to assure that the key of the user ("person A" for instance) held by "person B" belongs to the authenticated user which is "person A".

**.salt** is extra salt added to password hashing. They add an extra security to your application.

Once they have been deleted, no one can login to your application unless you use the recovery admin account that is automatically generated by your terminal.

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080. Then login using "admin‚Äù as username and password.
