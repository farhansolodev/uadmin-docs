`Back to Top`_

To display information about data access HTTP API, call this URL in the address bar as shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    http://api.example.com/api/d/

Result:

.. image:: assets/dataaccessapihelp.png
   :align: center

Add Multiple
------------
`Back to Top`_

Structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    # For writing data, put _ symbol first before the field name
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/add/?_(fieldname__n=value)

**Method**: GET, POST

**Authentication**: Cookie, URL parameter "?code=abcd" or POST parameter "code=abcd"

The model's fields could be added as parameters depending of the HTTP method. If a field is required and there is no value passed, the API will return a status:" 'error' with an err_msg detailing which required field was missing.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "error",
        "err_msg": "This field is required and no value is assigned or missing.",
        "err_f": "Name",
    }

To identify each field in the request, there is a suffix of __n where n is the index of the record being added. This is a 0-based index.

Suppose you don't have any records in the Document model.

.. image:: assets/emptyrecorddocument.png

|

Run your application and call this URL to add multiple records in the Document model with the following information below:

**First Record**

* Name: Golang
* Author: John

**Second Record**

* Name: uAdmin
* Author: Adam

.. code-block:: bash

    # document is a model name
    # name and author are field names
    # __0 is the first index
    # __1 is the second index
    http://api.example.com/api/d/document/add/?_name__0=Golang&_author__0=John&_name__1=uAdmin&_author__1=Adam

Result:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "id": [
            1,
            2
        ],
        "rows_count": 2,
        "status": "ok"
    }

It returns an array with a list of IDs for the newly created records.

To check the details of the newly created records, there are two methods: by visiting the Document model from uAdmin dashboard or by applying __in operator in the id field then assign the IDs of the newly created records to read multiple data in the API.

**Method 1:** Visiting the Document model from uAdmin dashboard

.. image:: assets/addmultipleresult.png

**Method 2:** Using __in operator to read multiple records in the API

.. code-block:: bash

    # document is a model name
    # id is a field name
    # __in is an operator used to read record(s) to find a value matching
    # any of these values
    http://api.example.com/api/d/document/read/?id__in=1,2

Result:

.. image:: assets/addmultipleresultjson.png
   :align: center

    # d stands for data
    # For writing data, put _ symbol first before the field name
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/add/?_(field_name=value)

**Method**: GET, POST

**Authentication**: Cookie, URL parameter "?code=abcd" or POST parameter "code=abcd"

The model's fields could be added as parameters depending of the HTTP method. If a field is required and there is no value passed, the API will return a status:" 'error' with an err_msg detailing which required field was missing.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "error",
        "err_msg": "This field is required and no value is assigned or missing.",
        "err_f": "Name"
    }

Suppose you have two records in the Document model.

.. image:: assets/addmultipleresult.png

|

Run your application and call this URL to add a new record in the Document model with the following information below:

* Name: Programming
* Author: Admin

.. code-block:: bash

    # document is a model name
    # name and author are field names
    http://api.example.com/api/d/document/add/?_name=Programming&_author=Admin

Result:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "id": 3,
        "rows_count": 1,
        "status": "ok"
    }

It returns the ID of the newly created record.

To check the details of a newly created record, there are two methods: by visiting the Document model in the dashboard or by using HTTP API to read one by assigning the ID of the newly created record.

**Method 1:** Visiting the Document model from uAdmin dashboard

.. image:: assets/addoneresult.png

**Method 2:** Using HTTP API to read one record

.. code-block:: bash

    # document is a model name
    # 3 is an ID number
    http://api.example.com/api/d/document/read/3/

Result:

.. image:: assets/addoneresultjson.png
   :align: center

It returns a JSON array representing newly modified iPad items where rating has a value of 5.

What if you don't specify which record do you want to update in the database? Let's call this URL to edit the rating to a value of 2.

.. code-block:: bash

    http://api.example.com/api/d/item/edit/?_rating=2

Now let's see what happens.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "rows_count": 5,
        "status": "ok"
    }

Based on the result, it seems that all rows are affected by your query.

To check if the rating of all items has edited, there are two methods: by visiting the Item model from uAdmin dashboard or by using HTTP API to read all records in the database.

**Method 1:** Visiting the Item model from uAdmin dashboard

.. image:: assets/editallresult.png

Read One
--------
`Back to Top`_

Structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/read/(id_number)/

**Method**: GET, POST

**Authentication**: Cookie, URL parameter "?code=abcd" or POST parameter "code=abcd"

Suppose you have five records in the Item model.

.. image:: assets/itemfiverecords.png

|

Run your application and call this URL to read the second record in the Item model.

.. code-block:: bash

    # item is a model name
    # 2 is an ID number
    http://api.example.com/api/d/item/read/2/

Result:

.. image:: assets/readoneresult.png
   :align: center

|

It returns a JSON object representing an item where ID=2.

Return Format
-------------
`Back to Top`_

The return format is always JSON in this format:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "ok",
        "result": {}
    }

Where **value** has the return value of the call. Not all calls will have a return value. In case of error you will get a JSON result that looks like this:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "error",
        "err_msg": "error message",
        "err_f": "Name"
    }

If the API should return a single result, then the value of items could be either an object or null.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "ok",
        "result": {
            "name": "item 1",
            "description": "description 1"
        }
    }

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "ok",
        "items": null
    }

If the API should return multiple results, then the value of items is always an array that could be of length 0.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "status": "ok",
        "result": []
    }

Schema
------
`Back to Top`_

Structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/schema/

**Method**: GET, POST

**Authentication**: Cookie, URL parameter "?code=abcd" or POST parameter "code=abcd"

By default this is disabled for all users unless it is enabled with method **APIDisabledSchema** and **APIPublicSchema**.

Suppose you have five records in the Item model.

.. image:: assets/itemfiverecords.png

|

Run your application and call this URL to read the full schema of the Item model.

.. code-block:: bash

    # item is a model name
    http://api.example.com/api/d/item/schema/

Result:

.. image:: assets/schemaresult.png
   :align: center

|

It returns a JSON object representing uAdmin's ModelSchema of the Item model.

API Permissions
---------------
`Back to Top`_

The API should check the user's permissions to ensure proper permissions before executing any queries or returning data. If there is not proper permissions then the API will return an error message detailing lack of access.

Logging
-------
`Back to Top`_

The API can log all access to data in the built in Logs system on uAdmin. This behavior could be controlled using 5 system wide settings:

* APILogRead = false
* APILogEdit = true
* APILogAdd = true
* APILogDelete = true
* APILogSchema = true

This can also be customized for any single model by implementing one of five methods:

* `APILogRead`_
* `APILogEdit`_
* `APILogAdd`_
* `APILogDelete`_
* `APILogSchema`_

.. _APILogAdd: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-reference/setting.html#api-log-add
.. _APILogDelete: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-reference/setting.html#api-log-delete
.. _APILogEdit: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-reference/setting.html#api-log-edit
.. _APILogRead: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-reference/setting.html#api-log-read
.. _APILogSchema: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-reference/setting.html#api-log-schema

Model Methods
-------------

* func (m \*Model) APIPublicRead(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIPublicAdd(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIPublicEdit(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIPublicDelete(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIPublicSchema(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIDisabledRead(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIDisabledAdd(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIDisabledEdit(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIDisabledDelete(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APIDisabledSchema(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APILogRead(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APILogEdit(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APILogAdd(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APILogDelete(r \*http.Request) bool
* func (m \*Model) APILogSchema(r \*http.Request) bool

It is necessary to have http.Request parameter in these methods for allowing and blocking the IP of a user on accessing an API. For instance, you want to access the built-in APIs for an employee within the company. If the user is outside the company, he cannot access the API.

**Group By**
^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Back to Top (Special Parameters)`_

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of purchased items in each transaction".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns. [#f3]_

Structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    # $ represents a symbol for special parameters
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/read/?$groupby=(field_name)

Run your application and call this URL to read a record that contains how many rows that matches a specified rating.

.. code-block:: bash

    # item is the model name
    # id and rating are field names
    # $f is a parameter for selecting fields
    # __count is an operator that counts the number of rows that matches
    # a specified rating
    # SELECT COUNT(id), rating FROM items GROUP BY rating
    http://api.example.com/api/d/item/read/?$f=id__count,rating&$groupby=rating

Result:

.. image:: assets/groupbyresult.png
   :align: center

|

We found out that there are two records that has a rating of 3, two records that has a rating of 4, and one record that has a rating of 5.

**Deleted**
^^^^^^^^^^^
Deleted displays the list of deleted records in the database based on the assigned model.

Structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    # $ represents a symbol for special parameters
    # value can be either 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled)
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/read/?$deleted=(value)

If the value is 0, it will return the list of deleted records. If the value is 1, it will return the list of deleted and existing records.

Suppose you have five records in the Item model.

    # d stands for data
    # $ represents a symbol for special parameters
    # stats_value can be either 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled)
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/?$stats=(stats_value)

Suppose you have five records in the Item model.

.. image:: assets/itemfiverecords.png

|

Run your application and call this URL to check the query execution time and its related details when you perform an action that reads all records in the Item model.

.. code-block:: bash

    # item is the model name
    # To enable stats, ?$stats=1
    http://api.example.com/api/d/item/?$stats=1

Result:

.. image:: assets/statsresult.png
   :align: center

|

It returns a record that reads all item records and stats containing the query execution time and its related details when you perform an action that reads all records in the Item model.

"qtime" is in milliseconds.

**All Models**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Back to Top (Special Parameters)`_

.. _Back to Top (Special Parameters): https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/httpapi.html#special-parameters

Structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    # $ represents a symbol for special parameters
    # allmodels is a parameter to get all models
    http://api.example.com/api/d/?$allmodels

Suppose you have the following models in the uAdmin dashboard.

.. image:: assets/uadmindashboardupdate.png

|

Run your application and call this URL to read the full schema of all models.

.. code-block:: bash

    # item is a model name
    http://api.example.com/api/d/$allmodels

Result:

.. image:: assets/allmodelsresult.png
   :align: center

|

It returns a JSON array representing uAdmin's ModelSchema of all models.

Writing Data Symbol
-------------------
`Back to Top`_

.. _Back To Top: https://uadmin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/httpapi.html#

For writing data (Add/Edit), we need to put _ symbol before the field name after the WHERE symbol (?) in the URL.

.. code-block:: bash

    # d stands for data
    # _name is a field name to be added with the value of "John"
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/add/?_name=John

    # d stands for data
    # name is a field name that was selected for updating
    # _name is a field name to be added with the value of "Adam"
    http://api.example.com/api/d/(model_name)/edit/?name=John&_name=Adam

Without the _ symbol, that field is a selector.
