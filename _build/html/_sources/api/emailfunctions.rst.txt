SendEmail sends email using system configured variables.

Function:

.. code-block:: go

    func(to, cc, bcc []string, subject, body string) (err error)

Parameters:

    **to []string:** This is who you are primarily writing the email to, it’s clear to both the writer and the recipient who is writing the email and to whom it intended.

    **cc []string:** This means carbon copy and it includes people who might be interested in knowing that there was an email between the sender and the primary TO, typically CC’s are not meant to respond, only the primary sender. Everyone can see who was included in the To and CC.

    **bcc []string:** This means blind carbon copy. The sender has added people that the receiving TO and CC are not able to see as a part of the email, someone on BCC is not to respond and they will not be included in the response from the TO or CC. BCC is often used to include a stakeholder like a boss to make sure they are aware of a situation but they can’t respond. [#f1]_

    **subject string:** This means what your email content is all about.

    **body string:** This means the content of your email. It would be either a job application, the letter of your friend, notifications from your subscribed website, etc.

        uadmin.SendEmail([]string{"myemail@integritynet.biz"}, []string{}, []string{}, "Todo List", "Here are the tasks that I should have done today.")
    }

Once you are done, open your email account. You will receive an email from a sender.
