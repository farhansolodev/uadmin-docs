Document System Tutorial Part 17 - Wrapping Up Your Application
===============================================================
So far you have developed this really cool application that you want to show to your your customer or even to the world. Before you dockerize your application, let's customize your dashboard in a fashionable way. Making it look good and customizing it to meet your customers requirements is important to the success of your app.

First of all, open **DASHBOARD MENUS**.

Open the models that you have created and let's add the Tool Tip that means the information you want to show when you hover the mouse to the model, an icon that you like to represent in the dashboard, and Cat which is the highlight of your model.

By default any model that does not have an icon gets this icon:

   :align: center

If you don't have any pictures or icons in your computer, I would recommend you to go over `flaticon.com`_, but you can browse anywhere online. Once you search for an icon, download the PNG version and choose the size 128 pixels.

Let's hide the Document and Folder related models in the dashboard. In order to do that, create a HideInDashboard() function that returns a boolean value which is true.

**document_group.go**

.. code-block:: go

    // HideInDashboard !
    func (DocumentGroup) HideInDashboard() bool {
        return true
    }

**document_user.go**

.. code-block:: go

    // HideInDashboard !
    func (DocumentUser) HideInDashboard() bool {
        return true
    }

**document_version.go**

.. code-block:: go

    // HideInDashboard !
    func (DocumentVersion) HideInDashboard() bool {
        return true
    }

**folder_group.go**

.. code-block:: go

    // HideInDashboard !
    func (FolderGroup) HideInDashboard() bool {
        return true
    }

**folder_user.go**

.. code-block:: go

    // HideInDashboard !
    func (FolderUser) HideInDashboard() bool {
        return true
    }

Result:

The Document System Dashboard is now much cleaner than before.

Once you are done with the setup, it's about time to dockerize your application for the world to see. Go to the `Docker Website`_ for more details.
