uAdmin Tutorial Part 3 - Image Cropping
=======================================
In this tutorial, we will discuss about cropping an image on the field with an image type tag in the model.

Create a file named category.go inside the models folder with the following codes below:

.. code-block:: go

	package models

	import (
        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
    )

	// Category !
	type Category struct {
	    uadmin.Model
	    Name string `uadmin:"required"`
	    Icon string `uadmin:"image"`
	}

Now register the model on main.go where models is folder name and Category is model/struct name:

.. code-block:: go

	func main() {
	    uadmin.Register(
	        models.Todo{},
	        models.Category{}, // <-- place it here
	    )
	    uadmin.StartServer()
	}

Run your application. As expected, the category model is added in the uAdmin Dashboard.

.. image:: assets/categorymodelselected.png

Let's create a new data in the category model.

.. image:: assets/categorywithtagapplied.png

As you can see, the Name field is required indicated by the * symbol. Required field cannot be an empty string. In the Icon field, you can browse an image file in .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif in your computer.

uAdmin also allows you to crop your images.

.. image:: assets/cropiconhighlighted.png
   :align: center

.. image:: assets/croppedicon.png
   :align: center

Once you are done, click the Crop button below and refresh the webpage to save your progress.
