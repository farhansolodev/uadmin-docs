Login System Tutorial Part 5 - Session and Cookie
=================================================
In this tutorial, we will talk about getting the session key if the user login is valid and setting an HTTP cookie for the user session.

Go to login.go in views folder and apply the following codes below:

.. code-block:: go

    // Check if the session is fetched from either login or login2fa
    if login != nil {
        // Create a cookie named "user_session" with the value of
        // UserID
        usersession := &http.Cookie{
            Name:  "user_session",
            Value: fmt.Sprint(user.ID),
        }

        // Check whether the OTP value from Login function is true
        // and the OTP Password is valid
        if otp == true && user.VerifyOTP(otpPass) {
            // Set the "user_session" cookie to the IP Address
            http.SetCookie(w, usersession)
        }

        // Check whether the OTP value from Login function is false
        // and the OTP Password is not assigned
        if otp == false && otpPass == "" {
            // Set the "user_session" cookie to the IP Address
            http.SetCookie(w, usersession)
        }
    }

The single most important job of a cookie is to keep a user logged in as they browse from page to page. A user's browsing history becomes part of a database which the website then uses to improve the user experience. [#f1]_

Run your application. Go to the login path in the address bar (e.g. http://localhost:8080/login/). Assign the username, password, and OTP password fetched from the 2FA image in /admin/profile/ path in the address bar or assigned on your terminal in the login form (e.g. admin, admin, 123456). Click Login button to submit.

Click the i icon on the left side of the address bar then select Cookies.

As expected, the user_session cookie was stored in the domain with the value of 1 that is the UserID of the admin.

In the `next part`_, we will discuss about redirecting a webpage after the user submits a form and passing the data object to the Home Page.
