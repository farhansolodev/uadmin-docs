Login System Tutorial Part 7 - Logout
=====================================
In this tutorial, we will talk about logging out a user account from the home page.

First of all, go to **home.html** in the templates folder and add logout button below the user login status.

.. code-block:: html

    <body>
      <h1>Login as {{.User}}
      {{if eq .OTP true}} with {{else}} without {{end}}
      2FA Authentication</h1>

      <!-- ADD THIS PIECE OF CODE TO CREATE LOGOUT BUTTON -->
      <form method="POST">
        <button type="submit" name="request" value="logout">Logout</button>
      </form>
    </body>

Go to **login.html** and add this piece of code to notify the user that he logged out his account.

.. code-block:: html

    <body>
      <!-- ADD THIS PIECE OF CODE TO CREATE LOGOUT NOTIFICATION -->
      <p>{{.Message}}</p>

      <form method="POST">
        <!-- Some input fields -->
      </form>
    </body>

Now go to **login.go** in views folder and apply the following codes below to delete the cookie when the user logged out his account:

.. code-block:: go

    if r.FormValue("request") == "login" {
        // Some codes
    }

    // Check if the request submitted is logout
    if r.FormValue("request") == "logout" {
        // Assign the message to the Message field of userContext
        userContext.Message = "User has logged out."

        // Logout the user in uAdmin
        uadmin.Logout(r)

        // Deletes the cookie
        usersession := &http.Cookie{
            Name:   "user_session",
            Value:  "",
            MaxAge: -1,
        }
        http.SetCookie(w, usersession)

        // Pass the userContext data object to the HTML file
        uadmin.RenderHTML(w, r, "templates/login.html", userContext)
        return
    }

Run your application. Go to the login path in the address bar (e.g. http://localhost:8080/login/). Assign the username and password in the login form (e.g. admin, admin). Click Login button to submit.

As expected, the logout button has been created in the form. Click Logout button and see what happens.

Now check the user_session cookie to ensure that it was deleted.

In the `next part`_, we will discuss about reading a cookie and getting the user from the model based on the value of the cookie to ensure that the user is active.
